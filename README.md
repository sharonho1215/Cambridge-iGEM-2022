# Cambridge-iGEM-2022

The code used by the Cambridge iGEM 2022 Team to analyse the antithetic integral controller. 

control_activation_antithetic.m and control_repression_antithetic.m is the linearised model implemented in MATLAB to find out the poles and sensitivity function of the system.

simulations_simple_model.ipynb is the simulations made with the non-linearised model of the simple 3 ODE system, together with the analysis of its associated integrator and comparison with open loop and negative feedback system.
