# Cambridge-iGEM-2022

The code used by the Cambridge iGEM 2022 Team to analyse the antithetic integral controller. 

control_activation_antithetic.m and control_repression_antithetic.m is the linearised model implemented in MATLAB to find out the poles and sensitivity function of the system.

simulations_simple_model.ipynb is the simulations made with the non-linearised model of the simple 3 ODE system, together with the analysis of its associated integrator and comparison with open loop and negative feedback system.

To get access to our model for the more elaborate model done on Simbiology. Please visit the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uNkTjSVoOzd3WRs8HEzvlBEswkzeWuI3/view?usp=sharing">Google Drive</a> link

Further description of the analysis of the modelling can be found on the  <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/cambridge/model">Cambridge iGEM 2022 Wiki page</a>
